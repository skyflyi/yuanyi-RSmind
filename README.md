Yuanyi Remote Sensing image Interpretation Large Model is a commercial remote sensing big model developed by Shaanxi Yuanyi Intelligent Technology Co., LTD. It covers the whole process from data acquisition and preprocessing, data annotation, model training to application landing. By combining the imaging mechanism, geoscience knowledge and massive and high-precision annotated data, Yuanyi's grand model of remote sensing image interpretation breaks through the bottleneck of intelligent interpretation of remote sensing images, effectively obtains rich semantic information in remote sensing images through multi-source and multi-mode self-supervision and domain adaptive learning, and enhances the model's perception ability of surface object changes and details in remote sensing images. Realize multi-task parallel high-precision real-time interpretation in wide-area real scenarios
